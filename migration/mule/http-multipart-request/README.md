# http-multipart-request

This example application illustrates the concept of handling multipart request. It also involves reading and writing a file using [File connector](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/esbconnector/details/5d6de1a4-1fa7-434e-863f-95c8533d3df2) and use it in a text/html resource.

### Assumptions ###

This document assumes that you are familiar with WSO2 EI and the [Integration Studio interface](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/develop/WSO2-Integration-Studio/), WSO2 EIâ€™s graphical developer tool. To increase your familiarity with Integration Studio, consider completing one or more [WSO2 EI Tutorials](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/use-cases/integration-use-cases/).

### Example Use Case
In this example we use two resources, one to output a html page which provides a form to upload any file. And another resource to handle the uploaded file (Multipart request) and write the content of the file to a preferred location by the same file name.

![HTTPMultiPartRequest]()

### Set Up and Run the Example

1. Start WSO2 Integration Studio ([Installing WSO2 Integration Studio](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/develop/installing-WSO2-Integration-Studio/)).

2. In your menu in Studio, click the **File** menu. In the File menu select the **Import...** item.

3. In the Import window select the **Existing WSO2 Projects into workspace** under **WSO2** folder.

4. Browse and select the file path to the downloaded sample of this github project ("http-multipart-request" folder of the downloaded github repository).

5. Lets add the file connector into the workspace. Right click on the **HTTPMultipartRequest** and select **Add or Remove Connector**. Keep the **Add connector** option selected and click **Next>**. Search for 'file' using the search bar and click the download button located at the bottom right corner of the file connector. Click **Finish**.

6. Open the **HTTPMultiPartRequestAPI.xml** under **http-multipart-request/HTTPMultiPartRequest/src/main/synapse-config/api/** directory. 

7. Copy the uploadFile.html file located in **http-multipart-request/HTTPMultiPartRequest/src/main/resources** directory to a location of your choice.

8. Replace the {htmllocation} placeholder with the copied path to uploadFile.html and {destinationDir} property value with the destination directory. For example, `/Users/user/Desktop/destination/`. The `destinationDir` directory path should followed by a trailing / character.
    ![Alt text]( "HTTPMultiPartRequest")

10. Run the sample by right click on the **HTTPMultipartRequestCompositeApplication** under the main **HTTPMultiPartRequest** project and selecting **Export Project Artifacts and Run**.

11. Open a browser of you choice and go to the following URL: `http://localhost:8290/uploadFile`.

12. In the html page click on Choose File button and upload any file. Then click submit.

13. Verify that the file that was uploaded to the html form is in the defined destination(destinationDir) Directory. And in the console log you can see the below log.
    ```
    `INFO {org.apache.synapse.mediators.builtin.LogMediator} - File Content-Type = text/xml`
    ```
