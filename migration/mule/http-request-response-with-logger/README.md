# HTTP Request-Response with Logger Example

This example application demonstrates how to use WSO2 EI to build a simple HTTP request-response application. This example was designed to demonstrate the ability of a WSO2 Integration applications to interact with HTTP request and read 
parameters from the URL. 

### Assumptions

This document describes the details of the example within the context of WSO2 Integration Studio, WSO2 EIâ€™s graphical developer tool. This document assumes that you are familiar with WSO2 EI and the [Integration Studio interface](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/develop/WSO2-Integration-Studio/). To increase your familiarity with Integration Studio, consider completing one or more [WSO2 EI Tutorials](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/use-cases/integration-use-cases/).

## Example Use Case

In this example, a user calls the EI application by submitting a request. (i.e., entering a specific URL: http://localhost:8084/echo). 

The application receives the request, sets the request path as the payload, and returns the payload to the end user. 

In other words, when a user types `http://localhost:8084/echo` in address bar of a browser, application returns with `/echo` and if the user changes the url to `http://localhost:8084/moon`, application responds with `/moon`.

There are two functions that the HTTP Request-Response with Logger example application illustrates:
1. Receiving HTTP requests and returning HTTP responses
2. Logging the payload

### Set Up and Run the Example

1. Start WSO2 Integration Studio ([Installing WSO2 Integration Studio](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/develop/installing-WSO2-Integration-Studio/)).

2. In your menu in Studio, click the **File** menu. In the File menu select the **Import...** item.

3. In the Import window select the **Existing WSO2 Projects into workspace** under **WSO2** folder.

4. Browse and select the file path to the downloaded sample of this Github project (``integration-studio-examples/migration/mule/http-request-response-with-logger``) and click **Finish**.

5. Open the **HttpRequestResponseWithLogger.xml** under **http-request-response-with-logger/HttpRequestResponseWithLogger/src/main/synapse-config/api/HttpRequestResponseWithLoggerAPI.xml** directory.<br>

6. The **HttpRequestResponseWithLoggerAPI.xml** is the graphical view of the simple http-request-response-with-logger service.

7. Run the sample by right click on the **HttpRequestResponseWithLoggerCompositeApplication** under the main **http-request-response-with-logger** project and selecting **Export Project Artifacts and Run**.

8. Open HTTP Client in Integration Studio. Follow [HTTP Client Guidelines](../../../docs/common/adding-http-client-to-integration-studio.md) to open HTTP Client if the window is not visible in the interface.

9. Make a GET request to *http://localhost:8290/api/echo*. Application presents a message that reads `/echo`.

10. Now replace the word `echo` with the word `moon`, and execute. The application responds with `/moon`.

### How it Works

This example consists a simple [Synapse API](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/develop/creating-artifacts/creating-an-api/) that accept a HTTP request and read the postfix of the URL. Log mediator used to log the URL prefix and [Payload factory](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/references/mediators/payloadFactory-Mediator/) mediator to set the payload.

After opening the Integration project, there are two projects under the http-request-response-with-logger main project. First project (named as "HttpRequestResponseWithLogger") is the WSO2 Integration Project where all the integration use-case related files are stored. Second one is the "HttpRequestResponseWithLoggerCompositeApplication", which is used as the Packaging and exporting artifact to the server runtime.

You can run **Composite Application** using WSO2 Enterprise Integrator server runtime.
