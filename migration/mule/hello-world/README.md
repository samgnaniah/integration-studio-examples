# Hello World

This application demonstrates a simple HTTP request-response activity. WSO2 EI responds to end user calls submitted via a Web browser with a message that reads, "Hello World". This example was designed to demonstrate the ability of a WSO2 Integration applications to interact with an end user via an HTTP request. The goal is to introduce users to Integration Studio by illustrating very simple functionality.

### Assumption

This document describes the details of the example within the context of WSO2 Integration Studio, WSO2 EIâ€™s graphical developer tool. This document assumes that you are familiar with WSO2 EI and the [Integration Studio interface](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/develop/WSO2-Integration-Studio/). To increase your familiarity with Integration Studio, consider completing one or more [WSO2 EI Tutorials](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/use-cases/integration-use-cases/).

### Example Use Case

In this example a simple Hello World payload will be created using [PayloadFactory Mediator](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/references/mediators/payloadFactory-Mediator/).

### Set Up and Run the Example

1. Start WSO2 Integration Studio ([Installing WSO2 Integration Studio](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/develop/installing-WSO2-Integration-Studio/)).

2. In your menu in Studio, click the **File** menu. In the File menu select the **Import...** item.

3. In the Import window select the **Existing WSO2 Projects into workspace** under **WSO2** folder.

4. Browse and select the file path to the downloaded sample of this Github project (``integration-studio-examples/migration/mule/hello-world``) and click **Finish**.

5. Open the **HelloWorld.xml** under **hello-world/HelloWorld/src/main/synapse-config/api/HelloWorld.xml** directory.<br>

6. The **HelloWorld.xml** is the graphical view of the simple hello world service.

7. Run the sample by right click on the **HelloWorldCompositeApplication** under the main **hello-world** project and selecting **Export Project Artifacts and Run**.

8. Open HTTP Client in Integration Studio. Follow [HTTP Client Guidelines](../../../docs/common/adding-http-client-to-integration-studio.md) to open HTTP Client if the window is not visible in the interface.

9. Make a GET request to `http://localhost:8290/helloworld`.

### How it Works

The Hello World example consists of one simple [Synapse API](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/develop/creating-artifacts/creating-an-api/). This Synapse API accepts an HTTP request, sets a static payload on the message, then returns a response to the end user.

As the name suggests, the [Payload Factory](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/references/mediators/payloadFactory-Mediator/) sets a value in the message payload. In this example, the value utilizes a WSO2 expression to set a static string on the payload. 

After opening the Integration project, there are two projects under the hello-world main project. First project, "HelloWorld" is the WSO2 Integration Project where all the integration use-case related files are stored. The second project is the "HelloWorldCompositeApplication", which is used as the packaging to export the artifacts to the server runtime. 

You can run **Composite Application** using WSO2 Enterprise Integrator server runtime.
