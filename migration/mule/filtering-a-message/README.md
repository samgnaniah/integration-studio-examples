# Filtering a Message #

This example shows how to use validation components within Anypoint Studio to validate an incoming message.  

### Assumptions ###

This document describes the details of the example within the context of WSO2 Integration Studio, WSO2 EIâ€™s graphical developer tool. This document assumes that you are familiar with WSO2 EI and the [Integration Studio interface](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/develop/WSO2-Integration-Studio/). To increase your familiarity with Integration Studio, consider completing one or more [WSO2 EI Tutorials](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/use-cases/integration-use-cases/).

### Example Use Case ###

This example application receives the list of users in JSON format. Every record in the list should contain id, email in correct format, object with information about user connection. Connection info should contains IP address. If all of the mentioned fields are presented and validation process is successful as well, we will see: *User records are valid!* in response of the HTTP call.

### Set Up and Run the Example ###

1. Start WSO2 Integration Studio ([Installing WSO2 Integration Studio](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/develop/installing-WSO2-Integration-Studio/)).

2. In your menu in Studio, click the **File** menu. In the File menu select the **Import...** item.

3. In the Import window select the **Existing WSO2 Projects into workspace** under **WSO2** folder.

4. Browse and select the file path to the downloaded sample of this Github project (``integration-studio-examples/migration/mule/filtering-a-message``) and click **Finish**.

5. Open the **FilteringAMessage.xml** under **filtering-a-message/FilteringAMessage/src/main/synapse-config/api** 
directory.

	</p>

6. The **FilteringAMessage.xml** is the graphical view of the filtering message service.

7. Run the sample by right click on the **FilteringAMessageCompositeApplication** under the main **filtering-a-message** project and selecting **Export Project Artifacts and Run**.

8. Open HTTP Client in Integration Studio. Follow [HTTP Client Guidelines](../../../docs/common/adding-http-client-to-integration-studio.md) to open HTTP Client if the window is not visible in the interface.

9. Send a POST request with the following JSON in the body to *http://localhost:8290/filter*.
	```
		[
        	{
        		"id": "8fa8435c-fca4-4b42-9b5a-e81f9bd9aa16",
        		"username": "bob",
        		"email": "bob@mulesoft",
        		"connectionInfo": {
        			"IPAddress": "212.141.190.171",
        			"MACAddress": "2A-7A-6F-D3-64-54"
        		}
        	},{
        		"id": "f125a585-df12-404a-8c80-711d117dd353",
        		"username": "greg",
        		"email": "greg@mulesoft.com",
        		"connectionInfo": {
        			"IPAddress": "128.211.42.181",
        			"MACAddress": "8D-BD-C3-C4-D8-A4"
        		}
        	},{
        		"id": "6d4747ee-eb00-4e81-b7dc-2b01585e6d99",
        		"username": "anna",
        		"email": "anna@mulesoft.com",
        		"connectionInfo": {
        			"IPAddress": "40.125.118.175",
        			"MACAddress": "9E-05-9B-68-8E-80"
        		}
        	}
        ]
	```

10. Examine the response body to see that validation has been not successful:
	```
        Email in record: {
          "id": "8fa8435c-fca4-4b42-9b5a-e81f9bd9aa16",
          "username": "bob",
          "email": "bob@mulesoft",
          "connectionInfo": {
            "IPAddress": "212.141.190.171",
            "MACAddress": "2A-7A-6F-D3-64-54"
          }
        } is not valid!
	```
        
11. As you can see email is not valid. Try to fix it with *.com* suffix.

12. Examine the response body to see that validation has been not successful once again: 
	```
        IP address of record: {
          "id": "6d4747ee-eb00-4e81-b7dc-2b01585e6d99",
          "username": "anna",
          "email": "anna@mulesoft.com",
          "connectionInfo": {
            "IPAddress": "40.125.118.175",
            "MACAddress": "9E-05-9B-68-8E-80"
          }
        } is on blacklist!
    ```    

13. Looks like IPAddress of that user is blacklisted.

14. In case that you will send valid message, you will see: *User records are valid!* in the response of HTTP call.

### How it Works ###

The following steps outline the process to build an application for validation of messages.

1. Create a new Integration Project by going to **File > New > Integration Project** and name it **FilteringAMessage**.
2. Create a REST API by right click on **FilteringAMessage > New > REST API**.
3. Keep **Create a New API Artifact** selected and click **Next**. Provide a suitable Name and Context.
2. Use ForEach Mediator to split the payload and filter mediator to add validations. 
3. Add required validation criteria.
4. Export capp and run the sample.
